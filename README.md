# Data Science Project: Airbnb Analysis of Boston and Seattle

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to compare two popular travel destinations—Boston and Seattle—to understand how various factors influence accommodation prices and availability. This analysis is based on data from two datasets provided by Kaggle:

- **[Seattle Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle)**
- **[Boston Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston)**

## Key Questions Addressed

In this project, I explored the following questions:

1. **How do the month and location impact booking prices?**
   - Investigated how seasonal changes and geographical differences affect the cost of accommodations.
  
2. **Which apartments receive the most reviews?**
   - Identified the most popular properties in both cities by the number of reviews, providing insight into customer preferences.

3. **How does availability vary based on location and month?**
   - Analyzed trends in availability across different times of the year and compared them between the two cities.

## Datasets

The datasets used for this analysis contain a variety of features including:

- **Listing details**: Information about the properties, such as price, number of reviews, availability, and location.
- **Calendar data**: Daily availability and pricing information for each listing.

## Analysis and Findings

The analysis revealed several key insights:

- **Price Variation**: Accommodation prices fluctuate based on the month and location. For example, Seattle tends to be cheaper than Boston, and peak prices in both cities align with periods of high demand.
  
- **Review Insights**: Properties with the most reviews tend to attract more bookings, suggesting that customer feedback is a significant factor in a listing's success.
  
- **Availability Trends**: Availability is generally higher in Seattle compared to Boston, with the latter experiencing low availability during its peak pricing months, September and October.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights the importance of timing and location in travel planning. By comparing different dates and places, travelers can potentially save on accommodation costs. Additionally, the number of reviews plays a crucial role in a property's popularity, offering valuable insights for both travelers and hosts.
